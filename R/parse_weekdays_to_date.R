#' @title
#' Converts a dataframe row from a string containing a weekday to the date of the next occurance of that weekday.
#' 
#' @description
#' Function is designed to be used for the E-6 row. It converts strings suchas 'Scans sent Friday' to the date of the next occuring Friday.
#' 
#' 
#' @param process_row_df A dataframe with a single row and the columns: `Service`, `Develop Only`, `Dev + Scan`, `Prints Add On`. This corresponds to the turnaround time table from The Black and White Box website. This expects the E-6 row.
#' @param date_today A single Date. The date from which to determine the next occurance of a specific weekday.
#'
#' @returns A dataframe. The same as the input dataframe, but with the cells replaced by dates representing the turnaround date of the various services.
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' # Setup mock date and test calendar. These are required by the function.
